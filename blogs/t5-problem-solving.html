        <h5>Problem Solving</h5>
        <p><strong>This week I got blocked on a simple problem</strong>

            relating to exercise 5.3 Altering the DOM. The last exercise required displaying a div element which is normally accessible by using the getElementById class. However, this was invisible so it involved writing a new function, makeVisible including the class, getElementsByClassName.
            I'd noticed in previous 'Slack' chat that this had posed a problem and focused on the array and how to deal with the value 0 being returned.
            I didn't know where in the getElementsByClassName to place the [0]. I referred to the 'MDN' documentation, searched Google, and played at will trying different combinations. Little did I know, I'd resolved the exercise but wasn't expecting to see the DIV displayed as a square represented by dotted lines.
            After much frustration I retired for the evening, I ended up posting a cry for help on Slack the following morning which resolved the issue.
          </p>
          <p><strong>I solved a problem in an elegant way</strong> by listening to my cohorts via Slack. I hadn't taken enough time to read the material and instructions as part of Chapter 2 "Program Structure" of Eloquent Javascript. Here I was scripting away in Sublime wondering why I couldn't validate the JavaScript I was writing in the browser. I started searching online for downloads and also playing with the menus within the VM.

          I dived in again thinking how far I was behind; I ended up further behind.

          Once up and running, some of the exercises I stripped back to basics and tried to work through in a methodical fashion. I had to refer to a couple of the answers to valdate my knowledge, or lack of as it turned out.
         </p>
        <p><strong>How confident do I feel using problem solving techniques and related processes</strong> At this point 'Trying something' has been high up on the list, closely followed by reading previous Slack messages. I get bamboozled very easily by Googling for solutions; it helps if you understand what you are trying to achieve. Sometimes it's just copy and paste without really understanding why, but the exercise has been completed successfully. Examples definitely help, although for me I really need to practise over and over writing out the statements, as it's very much like mathematics which I struggled with (and still do).
        Pseudo helps to a degree, but again, it's knowing in Java what I need to reflect the Pseudo in terms of arguments, operators etc. I haven't used the 'Rubber ducky method' infact I'm wondering what the hell that even is - I must of rushed through again. My approach to sprints requires further reflection!!
        </p>
        <p><strong>What do the functions .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() do?</strong>
        .map() basically creates a new array out of the results returned from an existing array.
        Applying .filter() to an existing array of elements will create a new array with only the filtered elements.
        The .reduce() function can be used to take a collection of numbers or a string of words and append or add them to a variable that you have declared.

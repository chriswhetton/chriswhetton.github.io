        <h5>Search Inside Yourself - Mindfulness</h5>
         <p>
        <strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong>

            I tried something similar to this late last year at work due to misunderstandings around work to be carried out. I had an individual 'loop' back their understanding of the conversation. Unfortunately, even though they understood, they still went off on a different tangent. Without knowing, I performed 'dipping' as I organised a meeting with other participants to establish whether it was my communication style that was causing misunderstandings.
          </p>
          <p>
            A caveat, this needs to be done in such a way that it's not condescending and treating colleagues like children.
          </p>

            <strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong> I've found walking in the past works wonders, even if its just a quick walk around the block. I will focus more on the breathing aspect and awareness of my body.

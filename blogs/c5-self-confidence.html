        <h5>Self Confidence</h5>
        <p><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</strong>

            Mindfulness is a path to self-awareness; through paying attention to what is happening in the present moment, taking both positive and negative experiences and associated feelings we build self-awareness.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Try at least one of the self-awareness practices. What was your experience, how did you feel?</strong>

            I practised body scan in a seated position. Although feeling relaxed, the body felt heavy in the areas of focus with neutral emotions.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>

            Everything in moderation. It's good to be self-aware and have self-belief, including recognising one's strengths and weaknesses, but over analysing can lead to paralysis.

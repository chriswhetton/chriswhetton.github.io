        <h5>Time and Habits</h5>
      <p>
      Well, in the time it's taken me to read the various links posted, watch videos on habit creation and time keeping, I've managed to have a couple of trips to the laundry, a cup of tea and toast, in addition to a toilet stop. I'm certainly a good candidate for changing; I find it hard to stay glued to the monitor and concentrate - there's always something calling, either in the cupboards or other places around the house! Perhaps I need to remove myself from the home environment for parts of Phase 0 and head to the library, including time onsite at EDA to really develop the focus and drive required.</p>
      <p>
      I've always been aware of starting off small to form habits, don't set goals that are unrealistic. Making it interesting is key, even though sometimes we all have work or chores that turn off us completely, there is no option or way out. I like the idea of time boxing but not so much reflecting on what's been accomplished within that period. More 'Pomodoro' with a rest then return with a rejuvenated focus for the next 25 minutes.</p>
      <p>
      I've downloaded the 'Headspace' app and will persevere with meditation. In the past I have dismissed this approach, and haven't given it enough time to see the changes. Looking forward to this, including structuring my day with walks at certain points just to get out of the house.

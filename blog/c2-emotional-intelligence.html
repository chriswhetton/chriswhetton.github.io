      Watching chapter 1 of Search Inside Yourself, I drew parallels with martial arts. When faced with situations or challenges outside of the comfort zone, by regulating breathing and body posture, you are better equipped to make clearer decisions without the mind been hijacked and loosing control through emotion.
      Emotional Intelligence is also about payng attention to the moment, not looking at the past or what lies ahead. Developing sensory focus for both intra and inter personal relationships.</p>

      Taking two minutes to relax and focus on breathing helped stablise the body and dissipate tension - although a good night's sleep would also help the cause.</p>

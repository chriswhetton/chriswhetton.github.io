    <h4>Question 1: What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    
    <p>
      The DBC / EDA experence from my perspective is one of 'learning to learn', not only from mental challenges, but from the people around you. This can be from attitudes, energy, life and previous work experiences, creating a unique experience for all. It seems a roller coaster ride commanding total dedicaton in order to do justice, not only to yourself, but to your fellow cohorts and instructors as well.

    <h5>Question 2: What are your impressions?</h5>
    
    <p>
    A framework is provided much like a building, how you choose to fit it out is up to you. One's imagination can run wild; what you put in, you get out. This runs true for all cohorts.

    <p>
    Most of my work engagements over the years' have required a "Hit the ground running attitude" although typically more reliant on others producing the code, and not myself. Now I'll be on the otherside :-)

    <h6>Question 4: Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h6>

    <p> 
    No, everything has been transparent.

     <h3>Fireside chat with Shereef</h3>
     <ul>

      <p>
      Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat video, one can draw many parallels between the DBC / EDA experience; both promote 'learning to learn', not only through mental challenges, but from the people around you. This can be from attitudes, energy, life and previous work experiences, which creates a unique experience for all. It seems a roller coaster ride, commanding total dedication in order to do justice, not only to yourself, but to your fellow cohorts and instructors as well.</p>
      <p>
      A framework / structure is provided much like a building, how you choose to fit it out is up to you. One's imagination can run wild; what you put in, you get out. This runs true for all cohorts.
      You need to keep on top of the weekly assignments otherwise things could snow ball rapidly out of control. A lot of reinforcement required (if times allows).</p>
      <p>
      Most of my work engagements over the years' have required a "Hit the ground running attitude" although typically more reliant on others producing the code, and not myself. Now I'll be on the other side :-) My expectations against what has been communicated has not changed.</p>
      <p>
      Overall, I'm looking forward to working in a disciplined way; having to meet milestones/deadlines, the challenge of working with different people (this is always a challenge). Slight trepidation that at some point concepts might not sink in.</p>

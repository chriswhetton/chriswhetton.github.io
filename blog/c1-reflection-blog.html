    <h4>Question 1: What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    
    <p>
      The DBC / EDA experence from my perspective is one of 'learning to learn', not only from mental challenges, but from the people around you. This can be from attitudes, energy, life and previous work experiences which create a unique experience for all. It seems a roller coaster ride commanding total dedicaton in order to do justice to yourself and others around you.

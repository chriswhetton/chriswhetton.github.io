     <h3>Grid Based Design</h3>
     <p>Grid based design is a way of keeping elements aligned and ordered. By breaking a page into columns and rows, the grid system speeds up and improves design time, acting as a guide for placement, position, and scale of elements.</p>

      <h3>Responsive Webpages</h3>
      <p>Responsive webpages adjust the way content is laid out on a screen based on the screen size and capabilities of the device being used. For example, a user of a mobile phone would see content shown in a single column view to that of a user with a tablet, which might display the same content in two columns.

      <h3>Semantic Structure</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure is the use of HTML markup; only selecting tags appropriate to the meaning of the content. Presentation and styling is the domain of CSS.</p>

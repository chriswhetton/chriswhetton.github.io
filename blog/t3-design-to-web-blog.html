        <h3>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h3>
        <p>
            A responsive site responds to the user's behaviour and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. It consists of flexible grids, layouts, and images. Responsiveness is important, for example, when a user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size, and scripting abilities.
        </p>
        <h3>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h3>
        <p>
            Historically, website development was approached with the desktop in mind first, while leaving the mobile part as a secondary goal. Given the phenomenal growth of smart devices, the mobile first approach addresses this by making the tough decisions first about the content. Content is structured in a hierarchy where the most important content is at the top, followed by the next.
            With a desktop approach you can put two pieces of content side by side, a mobile approach means one is above the other.

        <h3>What is a framework, pros and cons of using them?</h3>
        <p>
            A web framework is a software framework designed to simplify web development. Frameworks exist to save time and re-inventing the wheel. Frameworks provide libraries for accessing databases, managing sessions, and html templates for example - in general promoting the reuse of code.
            I've already touched on some of the pros, cons are there are a wide range of framework choices available, this can be daunting for inexperienced developers. Each has its own strenghts and weaknesses, including scripting language which have to be evaluated to match your site's needs.

        <h3>Why use a wireframe?</h3>
        <p>
          Before answering "why use a wireframe", "what is a wireframe?" Wireframing is a way to design a website, commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page. They are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
          "Why use a wireframe"? The aim of using a wireframe is to provide a visual understanding of a page early in a project to get stakeholder and project team approval.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of my own wireframe design, this hasn't been followed. Searching on how to implement, I found easier designs and associated examples, which have still proven a challenge.

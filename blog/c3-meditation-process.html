        <h3>Search Inside Yourself - Meditation</h3>
        <p>
            I knew of the benefits associated with meditation prior to reading chapter 2, both mental and physical. Traditionally I've always thought of meditation as sitting in a quiet room assuming an awkward position and making humming sounds; this was always put in the too hard basket. This doesn't have to be the case.

            Meditation doesn't have to be rigid, if you lose concentration or are distracted in some way, this is okay. You can acknowledge and move on. The key thing is not to react and see this as a failure; it's being aware and staying calm in the moment. Like going to the gym to get fit, meditation for me requires training and perseverance to become a habit. The benefits should follow.

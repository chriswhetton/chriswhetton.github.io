      <h3>HTML,CSS, DOM</h3>
      <p> HyperText Markup Language abbreviated as 'HTML' is the underlining structure for the creation of a web page. Like a human skeleton providing a placeholder for organs, HTML is the placeholder for content. Building on the skeleton analogy, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the skin and physical appearance; colour, height, shape, size and weight as examples.
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is like the Human nervous system, handling action, reaction, and computation betweem the brain, spinal cord, and nerves to the rest of the body.

     <h3>Boxifing</h3>
     <p>
     When a developer is handed a brief to design a web page, they'll be handed a mock design. Boxifying design is the process of dissecting the visual elements on a page into boxes. Working from top down, till the smallest element has a box around it. This way, the developer can better understand how to design the page by simply moving the boxes into the best position.

    <h3>The Box Model</h3>
    <p>
    When looking at the design and layout of a webpage, the term "box model" is used. It's a box that wraps around every HTML element, consisting of margins, borders, padding and the content itself.

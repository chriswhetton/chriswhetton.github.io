     <h3>HTML, CSS, DOM</h3>
     <p>HyperText Markup Language abbreviated as 'HTML' is the underlining structure for the creation of a web page. Like a human skeleton providing a placeholder for organs, HTML is the placeholder for content. Building on the skeleton analogy, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the skin and physical appearance; colour, height, shape, size and weight as examples.</p>
     <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is like the Human nervous system, handling action, reaction, and computation betweenn the brain, spinal cord, and nerves to the rest of the body.</p>

      <h3>Boxifying</h3>
      <p>When a developer is handed a brief to design a web page, they'll be handed a mock design. Boxifying design is the process of dissecting the visual elements on a page into boxes. Working from top down, till the smallest element has a box around it. This way, the developer can better understand how to design the page by simply moving the boxes into the best position.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>The Box Model</h3>
      <p>When looking at the design and layout of a webpage, the term "box model" is used. It's a box that wraps around every HTML element, consisting of margins, borders, padding and the content itself.</p>
